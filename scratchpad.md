## Lessons Learned

### Database Migration Issues
- **MariaDB Compatibility**: The `renameColumn` method in Laravel migrations doesn't work with MariaDB. Use raw SQL with `CHANGE` syntax instead.
- **Fixed Migration**: `0000_00_00_000000_rename_statistics_counters.php` - replaced `renameColumn` with MariaDB-compatible `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE` statements.
- **Best Practice**: Always check if table/column exists before attempting to rename to avoid errors.
